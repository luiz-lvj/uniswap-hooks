/**
 * @dev A Uniswap V4 hook that enables rehypothecation of liquidity positions.
 *
 * This hook allows users to deposit assets into yield-generating sources (e.g., ERC-4626 vaults)
 * while still making the same capital available as swapping liquidity in Uniswap pools.
 * Assets earn yield in yield sources most of the time, but are temporarily surfaced as pool
 * liquidity through Just-in-Time (JIT) provisioning during swaps.
 *
 * Conceptually, the hook acts as an intermediary that manages:
 * - the user-facing ERC20 share token (representing rehypothecated positions), and
 * - the underlying relationship between yield sources and pool liquidity.
 *
 * Key features:
 * - Users can deposit assets into yield sources via the hook and receive ERC20 shares
 *   that represent their rehypothecated liquidity position.
 * - The hook dynamically manages pool liquidity based on available yield source assets,
 *   performing JIT provisioning during swaps.
 * - After swaps, assets are rebalanced back into yield sources to continue earning yield.
 * - Supports both ERC20 tokens and native ETH (with proper integration).
 *
 * NOTE: By default, the hook liquidity position is placed in the entire curve range. Override
 * the `getTickLower` and `getTickUpper` functions to customize the position.
 *
 * NOTE: By default, both rehypothecated and cannonical liquidity modifications are allowed. Override
 *  `beforeAddLiquidity` and `beforeRemoveLiquidity` and revert to enforce rehypothecated liquidity modifications only.
 *
 * WARNING: This is experimental software and is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.
 * We do not give any warranties and will not be liable for any losses incurred through any use of
 * this code base.
 * _Available since v1.1.0_
